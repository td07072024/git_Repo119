Carl Linnaeus, the founder of modern binomial nomenclature, gave lemurs their name as early as 1758. With his declaration of the genus Lemur in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae, he included three species: Lemur tardigradus (the red slender loris, now known as Loris tardigradus), Lemur catta (the ring-tailed lemur), and Lemur volans (the Philippine colugo, now known as Cynocephalus volans).[5] Although the term lemur was first intended for slender lorises, it was soon limited to the endemic Malagasy primates, which have been known as collectively "lemurs" ever since.[6]

The name lemur is derived from the Latin term lemures,[7] which refers to specters or ghosts that were exorcised during the Lemuria festival of ancient Rome.[8][9] Linnaeus was familiar with the works of Virgil and Ovid, both of whom mentioned lemures. Seeing an analogy that fit with his naming scheme, he adapted the term "lemur" for these nocturnal primates.[10]

It was noted in 2012 that many sources had commonly and falsely assumed that Linnaeus was referring to the ghost-like appearance, reflective eyes, and ghostly cries of Madagascar's lemurs when he selected the name.[11] Up until then, it had also been speculated that Linnaeus may also have known that some Malagasy people believed that lemurs were the souls of their ancestors.[12] However, both claims were discredited since according to Linnaeus' own explanation, the term lemur was selected because of the nocturnal activity and slow movements of the red slender loris:[11]

Lemures dixi hos, quod noctu imprimis obambulant, hominibus quodanmodo similes, & lento passu vagantur.

I call them lemurs, because they go around mainly by night, in a certain way similar to humans, and roam with a slow pace.
