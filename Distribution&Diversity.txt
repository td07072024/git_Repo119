Lemurs have adapted to fill many open ecological niches since making their way to Madagascar.[17][29] Their diversity in both behavior and morphology (outward appearance) rivals that of the monkeys and apes found elsewhere in the world.[7] Ranging in size from the 30 g (1.1 oz) Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, the world's smallest primate,[30] to the recently extinct 160–200 kg (350–440 lb) Archaeoindris fontoynonti,[31] lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion, varying levels of social complexity, and unique adaptations to the local climate.[17][32]

Lemurs lack any shared traits that make them stand out from all other primates.[33] Different types of lemurs have evolved unique combinations of unusual traits to cope with Madagascar's harsh, seasonal climate. These traits can include seasonal fat storage, hypometabolism (including torpor and hibernation), small group sizes, low encephalization (relative brain size), cathemerality (activity both day and night), and strict breeding seasons.[15][32] Extreme resource limitations and seasonal breeding are also thought to have given rise to three other relatively common lemur traits: female social dominance, sexual monomorphism, and male–male competition for mates involving low levels of agonism, such as sperm competition.[34]

Before the arrival of humans roughly 1500 to 2000 years ago, lemurs were found all across the island.[29] However, early settlers quickly converted the forests to rice paddies and grassland through slash-and-burn agriculture (known locally as tavy), restricting lemurs to approximately 10% of the island's area, ~60,000 km2 (23,000 sq mi).[35] Today, the diversity and complexity of lemur communities increases with floral diversity and precipitation and is highest in the rainforests of the east coast.[2] Despite their adaptations for weathering extreme adversity, habitat destruction and hunting have resulted in lemur populations declining sharply, and their diversity has diminished, with the recent extinction of at least 17 species in eight genera,[29][31][36] known collectively as the subfossil lemurs. Most of the approximately 100 species and subspecies of lemur are either threatened or endangered. Unless trends change, extinctions are likely to continue.[37]

Until recently, giant lemurs existed on Madagascar. Now represented only by recent or subfossil remains, they were modern forms that were once part of the rich lemur diversity that has evolved in isolation. Some of their adaptations were unlike those seen in their living relatives.[29] All 17 extinct lemurs were larger than the extant (living) forms, some weighing as much as 200 kg (440 lb),[7] and are thought to have been active during the day.[38] Not only were they unlike the living lemurs in both size and appearance, they also filled ecological niches that either no longer exist or are now left unoccupied.[29] Large parts of Madagascar, which are now devoid of forests and lemurs, once hosted diverse primate communities that included more than 20 lemur species covering the full range of lemur sizes.
